# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in MCP Guard, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, email: **support@trustkit.tech**

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation within 7 days for critical issues.

## Scope

This policy covers the `trustkit-mcp-guard` open-source core. For vulnerabilities in the hosted TrustKit cloud service, please use the same email address.
